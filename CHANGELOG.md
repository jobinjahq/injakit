# Release 0.0.3 (2025-08-12)

### Allow .vscode but ignore .vscode/launch.json (#4)
This release only removes `.vscode` from `.gitignore` because the
formatting setup needed for a front-end package is hard, this way
developers can easily contribute in terms of setting up proper
formatting on their machine.
